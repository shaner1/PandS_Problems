## Introduction

Each week there was a new task to complete for the programming and scriptiing module which increased in difficulty. This repository document details my journey with python so far and highlights the skill I have learnt in this module

## File Description

Built with Visual Code Editor   

## File Description 

There are 7 task files in repository.

- ### Task_2: Statements

This was a simple program which took inputs from the user to calculate their BMI. I found this program straight forward and didnt run into any difficulties.

- ### Task_3: State

This program asks the user to input a string of text and then returns that string in reverse order with every second letter taken out. This program was also stragiht forward.

- ### Task_4: Controlling The Flow 

This program asks the user to input any positive integer, which it uses to outputs a sequence of values that ends in 1. This program proved problematic at first as I couldnt get the new values to append to the list but i found the solution in the whirlwind tour of python.


- ### Task_5: Data
This program outputs whether or not today is a weekday. 
This was simple enough but very interesting as it was the first time i used the import function.

- ### Task_6: Function

This program takes a positive floating-point number as an input and outputs an approximation of its square root. I really struggling with this assignment. The thing i found most difficult was understanding the maths and not so much the code. I had a few attempts and also ran into some issues as I deleted the first attempt from Github whivh caused some issues as the branches werent sync. I looked at a number of videos online explaining the maths. As I was struggling, I also looked at an example of how to code the function in python but tried to avoid using it.

- ### Task_7: Files

This program is supposed to read in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. Im nt sure if i complete this task properly. I tried to get the program to list out all the files in the current folder for user so they could select from the list to read, but i couldnt get it to work.

- ### Task_8: Looking Ahead

This program displays a plot of the functions f(x)=x, g(x)=x2 and h(x)=x3 in the range [0, 4] on the one set of axes. This task wasnt too difficult and a good example of things to come.

## How to Use 

To run these programs, go to your devices command line and type "python" followed by the file name:

Example python task_6.py
